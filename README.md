## What is DotBridge?

DotBridge is an open-source research framework that demonstrates advanced multimodal AI techniques for systematic knowledge extraction and interactive agent construction. Originally developed as a commercial product, it's now open-sourced to advance research in:

- **Systematic knowledge extraction** from unstructured multimodal content
- **Structured knowledge graph construction** from diverse content sources  
- **Real-time AI agent architectures** with contextual awareness
- **Production deployment** of multimodal AI research systems

> **üîß Simplification Roadmap**: Future versions will provide simpler entry points while preserving the sophisticated underlying analysis capabilities.

## üß† Core Innovation: Research Methodology

### 1. **Multipass Content Analysis**
Sequential extraction pipeline analyzing content structure, temporal components, and semantic relationships across modalities.

### 2. **Knowledge Graph Construction** 
Structured representation including teaching personas, engagement opportunities, timeline mappings, and Q&A derivations.

### 3. **Agent Instantiation Framework**
Dynamic agent configuration utilizing extracted knowledge graphs for contextually-aware conversational interfaces.

### 4. **Temporal Engagement Mapping**
Time-synchronized interaction opportunities derived from content analysis and embedded within agent response patterns.

> **üìä Current State**: The system contains ~7,400 lines of sophisticated AI logic. We're identifying opportunities to create simplified interfaces while maintaining production capabilities.
